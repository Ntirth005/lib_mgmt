## Library Management System with Tkinter (Python Project)
This project is suitable for beginners as a first project to explore Python and GUI development.

**Features:**

1. Manage book data on different shelves (configurable)
2. View a list of books in a selected shelf with details like title, author, publisher, genre, and quantity
3. Add new books to a shelf
4. Find books (under development)
5. Remove books from a shelf
6. Arrange books alphabetically
7. Refresh the displayed book list
8. Exit the application

**Running the Program:**

**Prerequisites:**
1. Make sure you have Python installed on your computer. You can download it from the official website: [https://www.python.org/downloads/](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
2. This program also requires the `tkinter` library to be installed. You can install it using the following command in your terminal:

```bash
pip install tkinter
```

**Download the Files:**

1. Download the Python scripts for this project
  
**Open Terminal/Command Prompt:**

* Open your terminal or command prompt and navigate to the directory where you saved the script.

**Run the Script:**

* Type `python library.py` and press Enter.

**Using the Library Management System:**

1. The application window will have two sections:
    * Shelf Selection: Choose a shelf from the buttons on the left side.
    * Book Management: This section displays the list of books in the selected shelf and buttons for various tasks.
2. Click on the desired button to perform the corresponding action (Add New Book, Find Book, etc.). Some features are currently under development.
3. Use the "Refresh" button to update the displayed book list after making changes.

**Note:**

This is a basic example. You can extend this project with additional features like:
    1. User accounts for librarians with different access levels
    2. Borrowing and returning book functionality
    3. Saving library data to a database for persistence
    4. Implementing search functionality by title, author, or other criteria

**Further Exploration:** (Things I intend to do in future)

1. Explore database libraries like `sqlite3` to store and manage book data more efficiently than CSV files.
2. Enhance the user experience by creating a more visually appealing interface using advanced Tkinter features or other GUI libraries like `PyQt`.

I hope this README helps you understand and use this library management system project!
